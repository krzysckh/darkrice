![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krzysckh/darkrice/master/what.png)

since THIS commit, i am abandoning the old colorscheme in favor of everforest
dark. the old one was **bad**

and yes, i'm really bad at choosing names

## needed:

- urxvt ([patched](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rxvt-unicode-truecolor-wide-glyphs/))
```sh
yay -S libxft-bgra
yay -S rxvt-unicode-wide-glyphs
```
- ~~i3wm~~
- ~~bspwm~~
- https://pub.krzysckh.org/dwm.tgz 
  (change theme to everforest in config.h)
- sxhkd
- bspwmbar
- discord (+ beautifulDiscord)
- vim
- vim-plug
- picom
- spotify
- spicetify
- dmenu
- agave nerd font
- figlet + 'speed' figlet font
- perl

and you probably should look into [my scripts](https://github.com/krzysckh/bin)
